Hello, thanks for downloading the game Cyberpuck.

OPEN THE GAME:

To open the game, you can execute the file "CYBERPUCK - Executable build.xxxx". HOWEVER, as ressource files are not included in the .exe file, the game won't work if you displace the executable out of its folder.


MENU:

The main menus can be navigated using the UP and DOWN keys, use ENTER to confirm and BACKSPACE to return to the precedent menu.

VERSUS MENU:

The second page of the versus mode menu allow to choose your character and the opponent's character. You can navigate the left list with buttons Z and S and select with TAB. You can navigate the right list with buttons UP and DOWN and select with ENTER.

IN GAME CONTROLS:

The player on the left can play with the keys Z,Q,S,D, dash with H and use a special technique with K, he can alternatively use a joystick/gamepad if one is connected.
The player on the right can play with the keys UP, LEFT, DOWN, RIGHT, dash with NP1 and use a special technique with NP3.If the player on the right is actually an AI, the commands are disabled.

Additionnaly, you can Pause the game with the key ESCAPE and End the Game with the key F9 (although it is more of a debug feature and count as a defeat in the Solo Mode).
